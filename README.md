# Bugs

- Champion image not always shown due to riot naming not being consistant (Fiddle Sticks internal name is Fiddlesticks instead of FiddleSticks like for example VelKoz)
  - This can be fixed by using this endpoint to get the internal champion key: https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/13.22.1/data/en_US/champion.json
